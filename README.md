# Declarive WebGL Rendering

The goal of this project is to build a declarive rendering rendering
library for the web API WebGL. This will be targetting WebGL1 not 2
due to WebGL2 having no safari support.

## Development

This project has been developed using `parcel`. To run just do this.

```
parcel index.html

# Or if you don't have parcel installed you can use npx
npx parcel index.html
```
